## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability pertains to the actual source code and not any of its
dependencies, you can send an email to <`ncottrellweb@gmail.com`> and explain
the vulnerability in as much detail as you can.

When reporting the vulnerability, please say what versions have been tested and
describe the steps you took to take advantage of the code if you did.
